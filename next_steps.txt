link in chkout tutvisu, goes to articles/tutvis

//Next Phase (initial style plan)
style this out section by section
based on plans in my head in a way
that is neither easy nor complicated
but which im reasonably comfortable
given the time constraints

no data anchors, just simulated data
for now including carousel images

possibly longest Phase

develop and execute plan for each section

the ultimate aim of this phase is to 
make the website take shape and look
aesthetically pleasing to an acceptable
achievable degree dependent on skill ability
